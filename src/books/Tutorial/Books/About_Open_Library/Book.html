        <p class="text-md whitespace-pre-line"> The purpose of the dhe purfekt inglix alfabet is to address the main issues in regular English writing and to fix them. There are certain rules in the standard English writing. However, these rules are not very strictly followed which makes it harder and in many cases confusing to write. This inconsistency mainly impacts non-native speakers who are trying to learn English for the first time. English spelling has many inconsistencies, for instance, take these 6 words:

Though
Through
Thought
Tough
Cough
Plough

Although they all have “ough” in them, they all are pronounced differently from each other. They do not stay consistent with the English writing and pronunciation. This is because through can be simplified and written as thru. Similarly tough could be written as tuf, and so on. Thus dhe purfekt inglix alfabet helps solve this problem by making english writing more consistent and actually make sense. For instance take the same 6 Letters above but written in dhe purfekt inglix alfabet.

Dho (Though)
Thrū (Through)
Thot (Thought)
Tuf (Tough)
Kof (Chough)
Plaū (Plough)

As shown above dhe purfekt inglix alfabet stays consistent with the pronunciation and the spelling of words. It does not use same letter to make different sounds but rather have different letters that make different sounds to stay consistent. Another goal of dhe purfekt inglix alfabet is to reduce same letter being used twice, for instance accident. It tries to reduce same letter being used twice in a word. For instance tomorrow is written as tumoro, and accident is spelled as aksident.
